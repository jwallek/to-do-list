# to-do-list
This is a simple to do list application where a user can add and delete tasks. The user has the option to mark each item either as "completed" or "important" as well as being able
to delete an item. Additionally, the user is able to filter through the list with the dropdown menu located to the right of where they enter the events. The options include: 
completed, uncompleted, important, and all. All new items are by default marked as uncompleted until further action. The user also has the ability to change the background image
by clicking on one of the three circles located on the right middle portion of the screen. This application has a basic local storage but does not save the status of the item, 
whether it was marked as completed or important. However, if the user deletes an item and refreshes the page, that item will be gone and the other items will still be saved. 

For the future, this project can add a login system as well as integrate a database system where users can login to their accounts and access their specific tasks, etc. which 
can be done with node.js and other applications.
